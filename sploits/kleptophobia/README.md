# Vuln

Simple SPN is given. Encryption is in CBC-mode.

S-box from this service is fully linear. You can [find](./get_traces.py) input-output bits relationship:

```
python3 get_traces.py
S(x)[2] = x[(1, 2)] ^ 1
S(x)[1] = x[3] ^ 1
S(x)[3] = x[5] ^ 1
S(x)[4] = x[(6, 7)] ^ 1
S(x)[7] = x[(3, 4)]
S(x)[5] = x[6]
S(x)[6] = x[0]
S(x)[0] = x[(2, 5)]
```
Every ouput bit depends on 1-2 input bits.

That means that attacker only need one pt-ct pair of blocks to find the initial key.

Public info of user contains enough information to define the lenght of serialized protobuf structure. Attacker knows how many blocks was encrypted and the value of all padding bytes.

Every user (generated by checksystem) has only 0-2 bytes in the last block + padding. Using [sploit](main.py) you can brute this unknown bytes and find the right encryption key (using z3 to solve linear equations).

# Fix

[Example](./fix.py)

Attacker need to know the length of serialized protobuf and at least one pt-ct blocks pair to exploit this vulnerability. And the easiest fix is to append some random bytes at the start. It would expand the total length and move known pt bytes to unknown places.

When you write one field in serialized stuct two times, deserializer would write the first entry and then rewrite it with the second. The final structure would be successfully deserialized and would't contain the first entry.
